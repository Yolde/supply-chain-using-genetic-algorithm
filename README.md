# supply-chain-using-genetic-algorithm
This project involves optimizing the transportation network between depots and refineries using a genetic algorithm. The goal is to minimize transportation costs by determining the optimal allocation of resources based on depot-to-refinery distances and refinery capacities. The project leverages Python and relevant libraries to handle data input, perform optimization calculations, and visualize the optimal network in a graphical format.

Key features:

Genetic Algorithm Optimization: Implements a genetic algorithm to find the best distribution of resources between depots and refineries, reducing transportation costs.
Interactive Interface: Utilizes ipywidgets to create an interactive user interface where users can input refinery and depot details, as well as transportation costs.
Data Visualization: Provides a visual representation of the optimized network, plotting the distances between depots and refineries with color-coded paths to highlight optimal connections.
This project showcases skills in algorithm development, data visualization, and interactive tool design for supply chain optimization.
